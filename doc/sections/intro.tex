\section{Introduction}

Image Analysis is the process of using various digital image processing methods to extract useful information from digital images. It is used for simple task such as finding shapes, detecting edges, noise removal as well as complex tasks such as the one presented in this report, counting of Euro coins from an image. These coins are commonly found in smaller denominations like 5,10,20 and 50 cents, as well as in larger denominations like 1 and 2 Euros. These coins vary in both radii and their color(hue) which, are quite good properties for distinguishing between the various coins. This report makes use of these two properties of the coins for devising an image based classification system. \\
\\

For the classification task, we were provided with multiple images of coins placed randomly around a checkerboard. Along with these images we were provided with the corresponding dark,bias and flat-filed images. Additionally a few images were captured to evaluate the performance of the system under different conditions such as lighting, number of coins, zoom, focal length etc. 

The basic algorithm for the developed system involves:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pre-process the image to achieve intensity as well as spatial calibration. 
  \item Segmenting the coins. 
  \item Extracting the coin features and classifying them based on the fuzzy inference system.
\end{itemize}
