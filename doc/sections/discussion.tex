\section{Discussion}

Our implementation of an image based coin estimation system is quite adept in
determining various coin denominations accurately under ideal conditions.
However, poor lighting conditions can sometimes lead to errors
as the it has detrimental effect on the image segmentation especially in cases
where the coin is placed completely on the checkerboard.

The developed methodology was first tested against a provided set of test
images and later on an additional set of experimentally obtained images to
evaluate the generalizing capability of the system. The system was not only
able to detect the coins in the provided image with absolute accuracy but was
also able to determine the denominations of the coins with a very good
accuracy.

For the evaluation set, the system was again accurate to a very good level. The 
error mostly arose due to low illumination compounded with 
the fact that the coins were placed on the checkerboard completely
making it even more difficult to segment the coins from the checkerboard background.
