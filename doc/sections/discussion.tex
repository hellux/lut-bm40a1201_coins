\section{Discussion}

Our implementation of an image based coin estimation system is quite adept in
determining various coin denominations accurately under ideal conditions.
However, improper lighting conditions can sometimes lead to large scale
misclassification as the coin's hue and size are not so well detected in those
cases.

The developed methodology was first tested against a provided set of test
images and later on an additional set of experimentally obtained images to
evaluate the generalizing capability of the system. The system was not only
able to detect the coins in the provided image with absolute accuracy but was
also able to determine the denominations of the coins with a very good
accuracy.

For the evaluation set, the system was again accurate to a decent level and the
misclassification rate was about 1 coin/image. The error could be attributed to
low illumination making it difficult to differentiate between the hue of the
coins especially that of the 5 cents when compared to 10 cents and sometimes
the coin shadows tend to increase the apparent coin area as compared to it's
actual area and hence leading to misclassification in some instances.
