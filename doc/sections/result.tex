\section{Result}

An implementation of a detection and classification has been implemented with
MatLab using the algorithms described in the method section. The effectiveness
of the classifier has been measured using the given measurement set as well as
an unbiased evaluation set. The total number of errors are displayed in table
\ref{tab:meas} for the measurement set and in table \ref{tab:eval} for the
evaluation set. Positive numbers mean the classifier thought there were more
coins of the specified currency than labeled, and vice versa for negative
numbers.

\end{table}

For the measurement set, there was one misclassified coin out of a total of 76
coins in 12 images. The classifier mistook a 20c coin for a 50c coin. For the
evaluation set, 4 coins were misclassified and 2 coins were undetected for a
total of 29 coins in four images. The accuracy was thus roughly 99\% for the
measurement set and 79\% for the evaluation set.
