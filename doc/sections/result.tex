\section{Result}

Counting of coins manually is quite a laborious task and distinguishing between them can be quite challenging even for humans and hence needs to be automated. Our proposed image based coin estimation system is quite adept in determining various coin denominations accurately under ideal conditions. However, improper lighting conditions can sometimes lead to large scale misclassification as the coin's hue and size are not so well detected in those cases. To counter this we went ahead with the  idea of combining fuzzy logic to our scheme. It's quite a novel idea and one that adds to robustness of our system against low illumination conditions.
